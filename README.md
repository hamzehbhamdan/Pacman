## Contributors
This game was developed by Hamzeh Hamdan using Windsurf and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It took about 10 hours, mostly because I was testing a version where the user can be the ghost instead. It was a really great feature, but I couldn't get Pacman's AI to be smart enough to actually avoid the ghosts, so I removed it.
